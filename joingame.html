      Welcome to msg!  This is a turn-based strategy game which you play with other people, entirely in your browser!  It requires no plug-ins (e.g., Flash), but you should have a pretty new browser, as it uses several HTML 5 features.  You've been invited to this game by {{ opponent }}.  You need to have a gmail address - we may support other forms of authentication in the future.  Feel free to look around the site.  When you want to start, just click on the link below!
